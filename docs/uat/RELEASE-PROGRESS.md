# RELEASE PROGRESS — 2026-09-28/29 (read this first after a context reset)

**Worktree (the only one):** `C:\wtrel` · branch `release/rc-merge-main-2026-09-29` → pushes to `origin/rc/web-uat`.
UAT = https://uat.tappyai.com (bound to branch rc/web-uat, audit DB `zdaprdfgpbpnxyofagmc`, behind Vercel SSO;
bypass secret in `D:\TappyAI-backups\vercel-bypass.txt`, header `x-vercel-protection-bypass`, never print it).
Check the running SHA: `GET /api/version` with the bypass header.

## Rules from the owner (2026-09-28)
- **PASS only with a real screenshot on UAT** (headless browser + bypass). Unit tests are not enough.
  UI items: screenshot next to the matching design in `D:\redesign`. Evidence → `docs/uat/evidence/release-2026-09-28/`.
- Only message the owner for login/password/secret, real-device tests, or danger points.
- Never write to prod before the owner confirms the real-device UAT. Phase B (release) unchanged.
- Claude may not type passwords into a non-localhost site → logged-in screenshots need the owner to sign in
  in the in-app Browser pane (test accounts: `docs/uat/MANUAL-UAT-HANDOFF.md` §1), then Claude drives it.

## Owner UAT on 3c5887a said: many "PASS" were really FAIL → round 2 (prompt 2026-09-28 afternoon)
